# Self-tracking app using p5js
Designing and implementing a screen-based interface prototype for a reflective self-tracking application.

This project demonstrates a concept kept for free interpretation as food can have widely different meanings from person to person ranging from mere sustenance to a way of life. Hence, we allow users to track their meals during the week through color, shape, and sound and represent it visually and playfully. The users are not presented with the meaning of their interactions with the prototype but are forced to create a meaning for themselves.

## User interactions
SLIDERS
- Regulate the color and sound wave
- Press and hold

MOUSE POSITION
- Regulate the shape
- Move mouse around

KEYBOARD
- Pressing “Enter” saves data
